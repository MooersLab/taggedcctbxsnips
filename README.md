# taggedcctbxsnips

This repo contains the cctbxsnips library for the Elyra-snippets extension for Jupyter Lab.
Each snippet is in a separate javascript file with the JSON file extension.
Clone this repo to the `~/Library/Jupyter/metadata/code-snippets` directory.
The JSON files should be inside `code-snippets` and not inside `code-snippets/taggedcctbxsnips`. 

Each snippet file has a set of metadata.
These data include a list of tags.
The tags are used to find the snippet while editing a Jupyter notebook in JupyterLab.
